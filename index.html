  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Brendan Lewis. I am 22 years old and an aspiring cybersecurity analyst. I have many hobbies and 
    interests, and I currently study at <em>Brigham Young University</em> and am loving every second of it. 
    I hope you can get to know me a little more!
  </p>
 <h2>Family</h2>
 <h3>General details</h3>
 <p>My family is kind of crazy. I have 8 siblings because my dad got remarried a few months ago,
    so I have recently aquired 3 new siblings. I have 5 siblings from my mom and dad, and I am the oldest 
    the 6. I have 3 little brothers, 2 little sisters, a step-sister, and 2 step-brothers.
 </p>
 <h3>Where everyone is at</h3>
 <p>My mom is currently living in <em>Washington</em>, and my dad lives in Houston with my step-mom. My brothers and one of my sisters lives in 
    Washington with my mom. My other sister lives in <em>California</em> with her husband. I honestly have no idea where my 
    step-siblings live though. My Summer time is the worst
    because I have to drive so much. I love my family a lot even though I have to travel for a long while to 
    see them.</p>


 <h2>Hobbies</h2>
 <h3>Magic, The Gathering</h3>
  <p>My favorite hobby is playing <em>Magic, the Gathering</em>. I have spent too much money on it.
    Dispite this, I am ready and willing to spend more. I like how free the rules are and how easily you can do
    mess with your friends while playing. I love it because it gives a large degree of freedom, while still letting
    you murder your friends. My favorite format is Commander and I am always ready to play with anyone else
    if they so desire. <em>:)</em> </p>
    <h3>Dancing</h3>
    <p>
    I also really enjoy dancing. I am on one of the <em>BYU</em> dance teams and I'll be performing in Christmas
    Around the World at the beginning of December. It will be fun to watch, so I highly recommend going if you have time.
    Although it is fun to watch, I have even more fun actually doing the dances. If you are looking to have fun, you should
    also 
    </p>
    <h3>My most slept on hobby</h3>
    <p>
    One of my favorite hobbies is sleeping. It is one of my favorite things to do, but I have recently been neglecting 
    it in favor of homework. It pains me to give up something I love in order to do well in school, but such is life.
    </p>
    <h2>Religion</h2>
    <h3>Which one?</h3>
    <p>
    I am a member of <em>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</em>. I have been for my whole life. My whole 
    family was as well for most of my childhood, but recently, all of my family except my dad have moved in other directions. 
    My mom is Buddhist, my sisters are athiest, my brothers have no idea whats goind on. Family reunions can get interesting.
    </p>
    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>I served a mission for my church in <em>Brazil</em>. I love Brazilian culture and the people there. </p>
